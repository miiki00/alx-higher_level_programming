# Test Driven Development (TDD)

## Description

This was an assignment from our school ALX Holberton about Test Driven Developmentusing the  python's testing modules [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) and [docstring](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/doctest.html)

## Test Driven Development
TDD is a very clever approach to building a software or application. It's the process where you'll have to write a test before writing the actual code so that you will reduce any difficults on the product during it's real world usage or for any use in general.
