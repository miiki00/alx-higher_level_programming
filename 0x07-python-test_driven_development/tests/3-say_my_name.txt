    This is the documentation
    for the module: 3-say_my_name
==============================================

Description: This module contains a function that prints first and last name in a
formated way.

Functions:
    say_my_name(first_name, last_name=""):
        Takes first and last name and prints it in this format.
            eg :- firts_name = "Your"

    # importing and adding paths where local modules belongs in.
    >>> import os, sys
    >>> sys.path.insert(0, os.getcwd() + '/../')
    >>> say_my_name = __import__('3-say_my_name').say_my_name
    
    # one character test.
    >>> firstName = "q"
    >>> lastName = 'd'
    >>> say_my_name(firstName, lastName)
    My name is q d
    
    # single argument test
    >>> firstName = "name"
    >>> say_my_name(firstName)
    My name is name 
    
    # all arguments test.
    >>> firstName = "Your"
    >>> lastName = "Name"
    >>> say_my_name(firstName, lastName)
    My name is Your Name
    
This test how the function handles invalid input.

    # both non str object test.
    # expect to raise a TypeError
    >>> firstName = 233
    >>> lastName = ("string",)
    >>> say_my_name(firstName, lastName) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: first_name must be a string
    
    # single argument non str object test.
    # expect to raise a TypeError
    >>> firstName = {"string"}
    >>> say_my_name(firstName) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
